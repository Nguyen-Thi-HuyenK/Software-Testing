#  I have worked as a Software Testing Trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing of a desktop application used in an X-ray detector system. The testing process covered various functional and non-functional aspects, and I worked closely with software, firmware, and hardware teams to ensure product quality.
