#  I have worked as a Software Testing Trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing of a desktop application used in an X-ray detector system. The testing process covered various functional and non-functional aspects, and I worked closely with software, firmware, and hardware teams to ensure product quality.
- Manual Testing Phase – Focused on installation, functional, performance, and regression testing

- Automation Testing Phase – Focused on updating and creating test cases using Robot Framework, Python, and Airtest

## 🧰 Tools & Environment ##

**🖥️ MobaXterm** – Used to remotely access and control the test machine for manual and automated testing tasks

**📋 SpiraTest** – Managed and executed manual test cases; updated test steps and results

**🐞 Jira** – Reported bugs, tracked issues, and logged working hours; collaborated with the QA and development teams

**📚 Confluence** – Used for reading documentation and also for creating internal learning materials

**🧪 Robot Framework, Python, Airtest** – Update, built and executed automated test suites for installation, functional, and performance testing

**🧬 GitLab** – Pushed automation scripts and updates to the project repository; supported collaboration with CI and QA teams through version control and test updates integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## ✅ Manual Testing Experience ##
### 🧩 Functional Testing
**🔁 Regression Testing** – Verified behavior after new changes and bug fixes

**🧪 Functional Testing** – Checked core functionalities against requirements

**🖱️ GUI Testing** – Tested graphical interface elements and UI workflows

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Testing
**💾 Installation/Uninstallation Testing** – Verified setup and cleanup of different app versions
