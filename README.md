#  I have worked as a Software Testing Trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing of a desktop application used in an X-ray detector system. The testing process covered various functional and non-functional aspects, and I worked closely with software, firmware, and hardware teams to ensure product quality.
- Manual Testing Phase – Focused on installation, functional, performance, and regression testing

- Automation Testing Phase – Focused on updating and creating test cases using Robot Framework, Python, and Airtest
